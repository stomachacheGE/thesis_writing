I would like to use this opportunity to express my gratitude to Northern Institute of Technology Management (NIT). I spent two fabulous years with colleagues, staffs and teachers from NIT. What makes these two years so special and unforgettable is not only the excellent education, but also the international atmosphere and the friendships we developed over time.    

I am also appreciated for the help and guidance I received from Prof. Dr. Corneliue Herstatt, Prof. Dr. Christian L\"uthje and from supervisor Dipl.-Ing. Moritz G\"oldner. I am really grateful for their patience over these four months and their attitudes towards scientific researches inspired me a lot.

Special thanks to all my friends who make my study life more enjoyable. Lastly, I sincerely thank my families. Although they live in the other side of the continent, their continuous supports and cares encourage me to step forward.\\
